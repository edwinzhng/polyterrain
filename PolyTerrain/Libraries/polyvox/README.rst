PolyVox is the core technology which lies behind our games. It is a fast, lightweight C++ library for the storage and processing of volumetric (voxel-based) environments. It has applications in both games and medical/scientific visualisation, and is released under the terms of the `MIT license <https://www.tldrlegal.com/l/mit>`_.

PolyVox is a relatively low-level library, and you will need experience in C++ and computer graphics/shaders to use it effectively. It is designed to be easily integrated into existing applications and is independent of your chosen graphics API.
